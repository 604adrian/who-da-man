This is a bash shell script that will remind you who da man whenever you are feeling down. The way it works is simple: you call the script:
`./da-man`
and then you will be prompted to ask who da man is. At this point please say:
`Who da man?`
If you fail to ask who the main is, the script will prompt you again until you close the program/your computer dies/the sun explodes/etc.

Once you successfully ask who da man is, you will be feed entertaining ascii aristry informing you who da man really is.

Then stick figures of people dancing will be echo'd to your standard output:


      o/   o/   o/
     <|   <|   <|
      />   />   />

Then, after all that, you should be able to rest saftely at night secure in the knowledge that you are, indeed, da man.

Many thanks to [this online text to ascii-art converter](https://texteditor.com/multiline-text-art/), without whom this bash script would have taken 10x longer to build.
